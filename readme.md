## Introduction
The Freebox Port Scanner and Exploiter is a powerful tool designed to scan for Freebox routers on a network and identify those with open ports susceptible to exploitation. The Freebox is a popular router model used in many homes and offices, and while it provides essential networking features, it may have certain vulnerabilities that can be exploited if not properly secured.

This tool serves as a security assessment utility to help individuals and organizations identify potential weaknesses in their Freebox routers. By scanning for open ports, the tool can pinpoint services and protocols that might be unintentionally exposed to the public internet, increasing the risk of unauthorized access and cyberattacks.

It is essential to note that the primary purpose of this tool is to raise awareness and promote responsible security practices. Using this tool against systems you do not own or without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have proper authorization before performing any security testing.

## Responsible Use

It is essential to use the Freebox Port Scanner and Exploiter responsibly and ethically. Unauthorized use against systems you do not own or have explicit permission to scan is illegal and may result in severe legal consequences. Always ensure you have proper authorization and consent before using this tool on any network.

Remember, the goal is not to cause harm but to raise awareness about potential security risks. If you discover vulnerabilities or open ports on your own Freebox router, take immediate action to secure your network. If you encounter vulnerabilities on other systems, report them responsibly to the affected parties or follow proper disclosure procedures.

Proceed with caution, act responsibly, and prioritize the security and privacy of others while using this tool.
